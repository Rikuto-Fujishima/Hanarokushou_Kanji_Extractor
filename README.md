# Hanarokushou_Kanji_Extractor
  In order to meet the demand of extracting Kanjis form Japanese lyrics put forward by Anime Club of Students and Nihongo Club of Student, I created this project in order to simplify the process on the Windows.

  You can get the setup package and install this execution on your Windows by unzipping the zipped files ended with ".001" and ".002".
